    <b>Petitions:</b>
    <br>
    This is by far my favorite petition. It shows a clear and defined solution to the problem. This petition is about the new "Hands Up Act." It would make it illegal for cops to shoot unarmed citizens. If the victim who was shot was found without any weapons, the cop would recieve a mandatory 15 year sentence. <br>
