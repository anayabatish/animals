        <p>At some point in their life, all chordates have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Central Nerve Chord</li>
            <li>Pharyngeal slits</li>
            <li>Notochord</li>
            <li>Tail</li>

        <h2  class="sections">Why are vertebrates a separate category after chordates?</h2>
        <p>All vertebrates have a backbone, but not all chordates have a backbone. However, all chordates have a central nerve cord.</p>

        <h2  class="sections">Buoyancy in Fish</h2>
        <p>Cartilaginous fish use an oil filled liver to control buoyancy.<br>
        Bony fish have a swim bladder which fills with air. They use this instead of their liver to control buoyancy.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hair/fur/feathers - birds and mammals use these for warmth and protection. This skin is softer but provides more warmth than other skins, which is essential because birds and mammals regulate their own body temperature.</li>
            <li>Dry scales - reptiles and fish use these for protection mainly. This skin is harder and more protective.</li>
            <li>Wet skin/scales - amphibians use these for protection. This skin is wetter and lets gasses pass through.</li>

        <h2  class="sections">Gills vs Lungs</h2>
        <p>Gills are used to extract oxygen from water, and lungs extract oxygen from air. Gills use diffusion and are located outside the body, but lungs are more fragile and located inside the body.</p>

        <h2  class="sections">Traits That Allow Reptiles on Land</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Scales - they have dry scales that are more protective of them.</li>
            <li>Lungs - their lungs are adapted so they can breathe air.</li>
            <li>Amniotic Egg - their eggs hold water and nutrients and provide a hard shell so they can survive out of the water.</li>
            <li>Senses - they can detect vibrations through the ground.</li>

        <h2  class="sections">Traits That Allow Birds to Fly</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bones - their bones are hollow and have a lower density, allowing them to lift into the air.</li>
            <li>Muscles - they have a strong breast muscle with which they can pump their wings high.</li>
            <li>Wings - their forelimbs are changed into wings to capture and shape air effectively.</li>
            <li>Feathers - lighter density and help the wings glide and the bodies turn.</li>

        <h2  class="sections">Hair - Mammals</h2>
        <p>Hair has many functions, such as protection, but mainly it is used for body warmth. Mammals are endothermic, which means that they have to preserve their heat. The fur traps the heat in the body.</p>

        <h2  class="sections">Live Birth</h2>
        <p>Live birth and live young are born more developed because they are given more time to grow and develop in their mother's womb before being born. It also provides more protection for the young as their mother protects them.</p>
