        <p class="stuff">
            Echinoderms live in all parts of the ocean. A few even live in the Artic! They usually stay on the ground and they live in all the depths.

        <p class="stuff">Characteristics that all echinoderms have:</p>
        <ul class="stuff">
            <li>They all have spiny skin.</li>
            <li>Adults have 5 part body with radial symmetry (body can be divided along 5 planes)</li>
            <li>Larva are bilaterally symmetrical (can be divided along one plane)</li>
            <li>Endoskeleton â€“ internal skeleton made of calcium carbonate </li>
            <li>Echinoderms are coelomates (have a coelom lined with connective tissue)</li>
            <li>Complete digestive system + simple circulatory system called water vascular system </li>
            <li>Food - The echinoderm captures its prey with its water-pressure powered tube feet. It passes the food to its mouth. The digestive enzyges are released in its stomach and the waste passes out of the anus. </li>
            <li>Breathing - They breathe with diffusion</li>
            <li>Movement - they have a system called the water vascular system that helps them move. Water is pumped in through a small hole called the madreporite. Next, the water flows throughout the body into balloon-like ampullae. After this, the water is squeezed into the tube feet and the echinoderm moves using the water pressure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2  class="sections">Invasive/Keystone Species</h2>
        <p class="stuff">Invasive species are species that usually are transported/travel over to a new place. In this new ecosystem, this species has no natural predators, so it is hard to keep its population under control. These can be very damaging to ecosystems as they can prey on a keystone species and its population can dwindle rapidly. One example of an echinoderm that is an invasive species is Japanese Sea Star, which used to live in the north Pacific but has now moved to the southern hemisphere.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, keystone species are species that are vital to the ecosystem. If one keystone species dies out, the entire ecosystem can collapse. Their prey can have a huge population growth, and its predators can die out. An example of a keystone species are sea stars. Sea stars are major predators of many animals and help to keep the populations of their prey in check.</p>

        <div  style="width: 50%; float: left;" class="stuff">
        <p class="stuff" >Echinoderms are an important part of the food web. They help keep many of their prey in line and are an important food source as well. They are secondary consumers and most are omnivores, which means they eat both plants and animals. They eat many animals and plants, including algae, kelp, plants, plankton, organic material in teh sand, mussels, and oysters. They also have many predators, such as crabs, sharks, otters, eels, fish, and other echinoderms.</p>

        <h2  class="sections">Benefits for the Ecosystem</h2>
        <ul class="stuff">
            <li>They provide oxygen near the bottom of the ocean so more organisms can grow there.</li>
            <li>They prevent the ocean from being overrun with seaweed.</li>
            <li>They are a major supply of food for many of their predators.</li>

        <p class="stuff">I'm going to Puerto Rico! I plan to go scuba diving there so I can see starfish and sea urchins and sea cucumbers! Fun story: one time I went to Puerto Rico with my cousins and we found a sea urchin! The picture shown here is my cousin holding the urchin carefully in her hand. I chose Puerto Rico because a) it has all the creatures, and b) I already have a fun story about it, and c) I loved it last time I went!</p>

        <div  style="width: 50%; float: left;" class="stuff">
        <ul class="stuff">
            <li>A sea urchin! It was just chilling on the beach. I identified it was a sea urchin by its red spikes and the shape of its body.</li> 
            <li>A sea star! It had 5 arms and it was reddish orange on the top and orange on the oral view. I identified that it was a sea star by its spiky skin and its 5 arms.</li>
            <li>My first brittle star! It had super thin arms with little spikes protruding from it. I recognized it as a brittle star because it was thinner than a sea star but with the same shape.</li>
            <li>Another sea star! This one was slighty more yellowish. It had 5 arms, which was how I identified it. It was lying on the ocean floor near the shore but too deep to walk.</li>
            <li>A sea cucumber! It kinda just looked like a cylindrical plant, but when I looked closer I realized it had 5 faintly distinguishable ridges! It wasn't a cylinder at all, it was just 5 ridges. That's when I knew it was a sea cucumber.</li>
