    <p>Locusts, a species of grasshopper, are swarming over East Africa. In addition to the coronavirus pandemic, Africa is forced to deal with something that is just as severe for them. Locusts are a type of grasshopper. They can grow up to 2 inches long. They usually avoid each other, but in certain conditions, it flips and they become gregarious, or social, creatures. They commonly swarm, but this year, Africa has created the perfect breeding ground for them. In 2019, unusually heavy rains and cyclones swept the land. This created a breeding ground perfectly suitable for locusts. The grasshoppers began arriving in late 2019, and the second wave, calle the second generation, is what is currently pestering Africa.
    <br><br>
    
    One problem of this outbreak is its timing. The first wave arrived after harvesting, which was good for the locals because they were able to harvest all their crops before the insects arrived. However, the second wave, which is still currently present, is eating all the new sprouts of plants during the primary growing season. Farmers will be forced to replant their crops, but they will not achieve much as they will have passed the growing season. Another issue with the timing is the COVID-19 pandemic. The pesticides that the farmers use to keep the locusts off of their plants are hard to come by. There are less planes right now, which means that the pesticide against locusts is becoming increasingly in demand, but without supply. It's also difficult to decide where to spray, because the locust swarms move with the wind and are not entirely predictable.

    We hope this will pass soon and wish the best of luck to Africa with their problem.</p>
